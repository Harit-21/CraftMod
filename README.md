## ✨ The Vibe
Craft Mod breaks the traditional web layout rules to treat the browser screen like a **high-fashion print editorial spread**. It features cinematic hero typography, heavy negative space, and a custom architectural blueprint animation that literally builds the brand's initials ("C" and "M") out of furniture right before the user's eyes.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎬 The "Addictive" SVG Studio Loader
* **Blueprint Architecture:** Uses SVG `stroke-dasharray` math to "draw" the structural frames of a cantilever chair and a trestle table.
* **Spring Physics:** Custom CSS cubic-bezier curves (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`) force the seat cushions, tabletops, and vases to "snap" into place with a satisfying, tactile bounce.
* **Cinematic Reveal:** A pendant lamp drops, the bulb flickers on, and the dark studio environment smoothly pulls up like a theater curtain to reveal the bright showroom.

### 📐 Asymmetrical Editorial Grid
* **Rule-Breaking Layout:** Abandons standard 3-column grids for an asymmetrical, overlapping masonry flow with drastic variations in aspect ratios (ultra-wide cinematic cuts mixed with tall portraits).
* **"Zoom-Out" Reveal:** Inverts the standard web hover effect. Images start zoomed-in and dynamically pull back to true-scale on hover while revealing typography.
* **Technical Cursors:** Replaces the standard pointer with a crosshair for an architectural studio feel.

### 📱 Exquisite Responsiveness
* **Desktop:** Features a fixed, vertical axis navigation bar on the left.
* **Mobile/Tablet:** Smoothly transforms into an elegant, frosted-glass sticky header (`backdrop-filter: blur`). The complex desktop grid gracefully collapses into a stacked, high-end editorial feed with permanent text visibility for touch screens.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic, clean structure.
* **CSS3:** Heavy use of Grid, Flexbox, Variables, inline SVGs, and advanced Keyframe animations.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Exactly 15 lines of JS used solely to calculate the perfect synchronization between the CSS physics and the DOM reveal. 
* **Zero Dependencies:** No React, no GSAP, no Tailwind, no build tools. Just pure, highly optimized browser code.
